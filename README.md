# Understanding Kalman Filter
<br />

#### Implemented Kalman filter from scratch.

<br />

Scenario & Overview:
* Vehicle moves in x-direction
* Real values of x-position and x-velocity were generated
* Vehicle model/plant was created to predict values of x-position and x-velocity
* Measurements of the same were obtained by adding gaussian noise to real values
* Kalman Filter was implemented to obtain the best estimations
